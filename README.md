# huntress-helper
macOS malware workflow based on [Huntress' research](https://www.huntress.com/blog/inside-bluenoroff-web3-intrusion-analysis). Generates logs for detection.


1. Do some sort of social engineering to get the user to need support for some social media or software. In this project, we will use Zoom. 
2. Have the user run: `zoom_sdk_support.scpt`. This will download the `/tmp/zoom_payload.sh`
